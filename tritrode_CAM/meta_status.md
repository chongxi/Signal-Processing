#Tritrode Experiment log

Practice end, real experiment start:

**09/12/2015 1st:** `fail`

Examing point: After assembling, before mounting 

tip | ring | pin
--- | --- | ---
good | good  | good

Examing point: under ACSF, before entering slice 

tip | ring | pin
--- | --- | ---
good | ``fall off``  | good

- tritrode ring broke and fall off the tip when mountng it on the pipette holder, the reason might be the `angular displacement` between the glass and the white pin holder.

- Recording from cortex L2/3, no spiking activity
- Noise level(300-2000Hz): 100uV
- Give stimulation but no spiking get
- Give the buzz from intracelluar channel, and observe voltage change on 3 tritrode sites
- Use the stimulation box to mimic spiking activity and get artificial spike with different amplitude at 4 sites, which indicate connection is good
- Add KCl to increase the population activities but no effect has been observed
